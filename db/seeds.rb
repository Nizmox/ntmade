Content.create(:name => "Who are we?", :content_type => "About Us", :body => "93 Made Games is an Australian game design and publishing company. In fact, 93 Made Games is the only company in Australia that develops and produces its own card games and board games all of the way from the concept stage through to, and including, distribution and marketing. The company even has an in-house art department with artists and graphic designers. Like most game publishers, the only thing that 93 Made Games truly out-sources is the manufacturing of its games.\r\n\r\nThe company has released two games to date - [Viewpoint](http://localhost:3000/games/1) and Viewpoint Reflections - and has several games in varying stages of development. The next game 93 Made Games has scheduled for release is Monster Town - a tribal horror adventure game.\r\n\r\nWhilst 93 Made Games has a significant backlog of ideas and developmental games and is not currently considering unsolicited game submissions, we are always open to hearing your ideas about what would make a good game. Please feel free to email our designers to discuss your ideas or anything else related to the games industry.\r\n\r\n[Sean Carroll](mailto:sean@93made.com) - designer of Viewpoint, Viewpoint Reflections, Show'n'Go, Horrorville and Void\r\n\r\n[Anthony Condos](mailto:anthony@93made.com) - designer of Monster Town, Gladitorus Millennia and Gladitorus Futuristica")
Content.create(:name => "Our History", :content_type => "About Us", :body => "G'day Gamers! My name is Sean Carroll and I am a founding member and the Managing Director of 93 Made Games. I'd like to tell you a little bit about what it is like to be in the games industry, why I chose to become a part of it and how 93 Made Games came into existence.\r\n\r\nI have many duties as a part of my position with 93 Made Games. These range from the enjoyable (meeting awesome people, playing and designing exciting games) to the less enjoyable (lodging tax statements, writing business plans and negotiating contracts). As you can see, owning and running a game design company isn't all fun and games but I can assure you the hard work all is worth it once you open up that first box of your latest game. Getting to see the fruits of your labour is an extremely rewarding experience, which is one of the key reasons why I got into the games industry.\r\n\r\nI first started designing games way back in high school (this would have been circa 1995). Being a major Star Trek fan, I created my version of a Star Trek role-playing game. I based the attributes of the characters and the game-play on a cross between Dungeons and Dragons and the Star Trek Customisable Card Game. OK, so it wasn't a particularly unique game but at least it was a game and something that allowed me to flex my game design muscles. And people at high school also played it so it couldn't have been that bad.\r\n\r\nAround the same time in high school, I was heavily into playing other games like Magic: The Gathering, Warhammer 40000, Blood Bowl and plenty of PC and console games. These are pretty standard hobbies for many teenage boys but I always took them further than just playing the games. I began creating new cards to use with Magic: The Gathering and some of the other card games out at the time. I created my own Warhammer 40000 scenarios (this is back in the day when the original Rogue Trader rules were still around). And with Blood Bowl, I would usually be the organiser of our leagues. I realised I didn't just want to play games, I wanted to experience every element of games, including from the design and development to the organised play.\r\n\r\nMy pursuit of this hobby continued through the rest of high school into university, where it was put on hiatus for a bit whilst I completed my engineering degree, and into full time employment. Favourable circumstances eventually led me from Canberra to Sydney where I began working for a large engineering company called Thales Australia. Whilst the company itself isn't that important to my story, the people I met there are integral. I had always associated myself with other gamers but, until I moved to Sydney, I had never met anyone else who wanted to design games. I met a few key people at Thales Australia, including Alan Chan and Anthony Condos, the latter of whom joined me in founding 93 Made Games. Around this time, I had also caught up with some old Canberra friends who, I hadn't previously realised, were also interested in game design and similar endeavours.\r\n\r\nSo Alan, Anthony, my Canberra friends (Ben Yeoh, Lisa Batkin and Jamie Griffin) and I began brainstorming ideas for games. We focussed on our talents (artistic, design, prose) and interests (sport, sci-fi, fantasy) to come up with a collection of ideas, which we short-listed to a few potential projects. The most popular ideas were a rugby league card game, a sci-fi customisable card game / fiction series and a medieval card game. Whilst Anthony and I lead the development of the medieval card game and rugby league card game, respectively, everyone had a stake in the development of the sci-fi customisable card game / fiction series, which was dubbed 'Renaissance'. Jamie and Anthony were responsible for preparing concept artwork for Renaissance. Alan and I developed and play-tested the rules and Ben and Lisa provided support where needed. Everyone contributed to the storyline, with Anthony, Alan and I developing three interconnected stories based in different time frames.\r\n\r\nAs the development of Renaissance continued, Anthony and I realised that, if we were to do things properly, we would have to turn our hobby into a business. At the same stage, the others had to reduce their commitment to Renaissance for a variety of reasons. So this was the point at which 93 Made Games was created. On 18 April 2008, Julia (my wife), Anthony and I registered the company '93 Made Pty Ltd'. '93' comes from the first two digits on Australian barcodes and when grouped with 'Made' is supposed to mean 'Australian made'. Well that's the rationale for us anyway. A year later, we registered the trading name '93 Made Games' to emphasise that our main business is in producing Australian made games.\r\n\r\nSo we were an official, ridgy-didge, true blue games company. The only thing wrong was that we hadn't produced any games. We began having more and more frequent brainstorming and play-testing sessions and had settled on developing the rugby league card game, medieval card game and a few other games. We decided to postpone the development of Renaissance as it was simply too large a project to do for our first game. As the months rolled on, the medieval card game was also put on hold and the rugby league card game development progressed slowly. Anthony had come up with a medieval miniature battle game (now known as Gladitorus Millennia) and I had an epiphany one morning, where an idea sprang into my head for a game where the elements are based on the theme of vision. This game would eventually become Viewpoint, our first game release.\r\n\r\nSince the release of Viewpoint at Gencon Oz 2009, we have been developing and releasing new and intriguing games for enjoyment by Australian gamers, first and foremost, and the rest of the world. I feel I am quite spoilt by being part of the games industry. This is exemplified by the boundless support we receive from our fans. They are a big part of our company and assist us in play-testing and promoting our games and by giving us so much valuable feedback. I'm not going to finish by saying something overly corny like, 'I am living my dream'. In reality, my dream is to be able to laze on a tropical island with my family for the rest of my years. However, if I had a second choice, and I do, then it would be to design games for living.")

                    :content => "*93 Made Games Managing Director, Sean Carroll, talks about his unexpected experiences at PAX Aus 2013 - the first Penny Arcade Expo held outside of the United States.*\r\n\r\n#####Warning: This article contains many âshout-outsâ to the wonderful people that I met at PAX Aus.\r\n\r\nAlright, I've been to plenty of expos and conventions over my time as both visitor and exhibitor and have learnt to generally ignore the hype coming from organisers. In all fairness, show conveners need to big note their expo; otherwise, who would bother to show up in the first place. This is what I thought PAX Aus would be like. The [PAX Aus website](http://aus.paxsite.com/) was replete with event listings and exhibitor names but I was very ho-hum about the whole thing apart from the fact that I would get the chance to join some great people on the [Indie Board Game Design Panel](http://aus.paxsite.com/schedule/panel/indie-board-games-making-your-own-tabletop-game). I was so blasÃ© that I booked a late flight out on the opening day of the expo and an early flight back on the closing day. Thus limiting my expo exposure to less than half of the time available.\r\n\r\n**[Cut to the PAX Aus Queue Room at 4:30pm on Day 1]**\r\n\r\nI strolled in and I was like, âOK, the Queue Room is bigger than most expos I've been to.â It was impressive; however. I didn't want to be hasty in judgement so I took some time to check out the other halls after getting my speaker pass. The pass came in very handy for jumping queues all weekend. I can't complain about a little rock star treatment.\r\n\r\n| ![The PAX Aus 2013 speaker pass](http://www.93madegames.com.au/images/paxspeakerpass.jpg){: .img-medium} |\r\n| The PAX Aus 2013 speaker pass was very useful for queue jumping. |\r\n{: .img-caption}\r\n\r\n**[10 minutes later, cut to the Expo Hall]**\r\n\r\nI stepped through the front doors and looked out across a dimly-lit hall that was filled wall-to-wall with buzzing stands and towering wide screen displays offering the ultimate in PC and console gaming experiences. I thought, âHmmmm, well, this is rather promising but I'm only a casual computer gamer. I like electronic games but I just don't get as much time to play as I used to.â Even so, I took some time to walk around and check out the latest games from local and overseas developers.\r\n\r\nThe Expo Hall needed to be dark to contrast with so many bright screens.\r\n\r\n**[20 minutes later, cut to The Big Top]**\r\n\r\nAfter walking past line after line of expo-goers queuing for hot food, seminars, DJ sets, special invitation events and so on, I reached The Big Top. This is where my cynicism was finally tipped over the edge. (It only took 30 minutes!) I peered across the vast expanse of The Big Top, which was populated with rows of modern consoles, costume-clad pop culture fanatics, herds of gamers with their heads down in their portable consoles, columns of tabletop gamers playing released and play-test versions of games, more hot food, retail stalls and, my personal favourite, retro consoles! I was in pop culture heaven... and I wasn't alone. The preliminary figures from the show conveners claim that there were at least 35,000 unique visitors to PAX Aus. That's more than half the current population of my home town.\r\n\r\n| ![Pax Big Top](http://www.93madegames.com.au/images/paxbigtop1.jpg){: .img-large} |\r\n| Seriously, I think you'd need to capture this shot from space to accurately show how large The Big Top is. |\r\n{: .img-caption}\r\n\r\nFor the next few hours I took in the whole experience as I ambled around The Big Top. Even though the expo was massive, I ran into some familiar faces, including Andrew Lum from [Aetherworks](http://www.aetherworks.com.au/). He was playing Magic against enthusiastic newbie Nicole, whilst her friend Ben watched on. Nicole almost demanded that I sit down and was all too accommodating when I asked if I could challenge her to a game or two. After conversing with Ben for a while, I found out that both he and Nicole were also Sydneysiders. The number of people venturing South for PAX Aus was quite astounding.\r\n\r\nTime ran out for playing Magic as I had to dash to meet with the other panellists. I ran across to the board game free-play tables and was met with an extremely welcoming reception from Alex Dijk and Paul Nicholas from [Blue Room Games](http://blueroom.labvc.com.au/), Wesley Lamont from RAEZ, Anthony Sweet from [Handwritten Games](http://www.handwrittengames.com/) and Thomas Eliot from [Sixpence Games](http://sixpencegames.com/). We went through our game plan for the following day's panel, which didn't take long as everyone was extremely professional in nature and definitely new their game design theory and practice.\r\n\r\nEveryone had to run off after the meeting so I took this opportunity to grab a snack and continue wandering around The Big Top. After filling my belly, I decided to settle down in the Retro Consoles area where I would spend the remainder of Day 1 playing old favourites such as Mega Man, Space Invaders and Batman (the 1989 movie version).\r\n\r\n| ![Pax Retro Consoles](http://www.93madegames.com.au/images/paxretroconsoles.jpg){: .img-large} |\r\n| This was my main haunt for the weekend. |\r\n{: .img-caption}\r\n\r\nDay 2 was a bit more business-orientated as I caught up with industry luminaries such as Gerard How from [Paradigm Infinitum Games](http://www.pi.com.sg/), Christopher Badell and Adam Rebottaro from [Greater Than Games](http://greaterthangames.com/), Dann May from [Game Salute](http://gamesalute.com/) and Sol Green from EuroGameFest. Gerard and I discussed plans for a big Southeast Asian release of Monster Town, Zombie Viewpoint and the re-release of Viewpoint and Viewpoint Reflections.\r\n\r\nI had a chance to try out some games seen in Australia for the first time but the clock was against me again as I had to hot-step it to my 6:30pm rendezvous with the Indie Board Game Design Panel. I won't harp on too much about the panel as the other guys prepared a video of the panel, which you can watch below. I will say, however, that imparting wisdom to up and coming game designers is one of the most enjoyable parts of being a game designer and publisher. I think Alex and Paul would say that having groupies cheer you on is also boast-worthy. Kudos Hannah!\r\n\r\n| ![Pax Panel Audience](http://www.93madegames.com.au/images/paxpanelaudience.jpg){: .img-large} |\r\n| These guys were great. What an audience! |\r\n{: .img-caption}\r\n\r\nAfter the panel, Melissa Rogerson from Boardgames Australia, organised a few tables for the panellists to demo our games. Once again, this was an awesome experience as I got to share Viewpoint with other gamers and got to know some more game designers in the process. A big wave goes out to Tom, Diran, Rebecca and Lachlan. Thanks for letting me win at least one of the games. A âheyaâ also goes out to Jeremy and David from [LXG](http://qlegs.wordpress.com/). I'm looking forward to seeing you next year in God's Own Country for some more gaming shenanigans.\r\n\r\nThe demos didn't stop there as I got to play-test Anthony Sweet's latest creation - Breakwater - until Day 2 closing time. I love the New Orleans voodoo/steam punk theme. This is going to be a great game so I recommend that everyone buy it. Be sure to buy Alex and Paul's game [Ninjitzoo!](http://blueroom.labvc.com.au/ninjitzoo/), Tom's game [Professor Pugnacious](http://sixpencegames.com/professor-pugnacious-portfolio-of-perils-pugilism-and-perfidy-the-card-game-of-victorian-combat/) and Wez's game Gaeon as well.\r\n\r\nWith the business and panel out of the way, I squeezed in some time on Day 3 in the Expo Hall and The Big Top playing PC and console games and snapping up some bargains from the retail stalls. I said my goodbyes (rather see-you-laters) to Anthony and Wez as I made my way out of PAX Aus 2013.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, I will be back next year... and this time... I'm bringing reinforcements.\r\n\r\n###[Watch the Pax Game Designer's Panel here](http://youtu.be/NzDA0T-JlQQ)",

        :description => "**The story so far...**\r\n\r\nMonster Town is overrun by monsters! This is a game of gang warfare on a completely different level of reality. You are the leader of a gang that must travel through the town in an attempt not only to survive but to dominate!\r\n\r\nSquad of Human soldiers - These guys are heavily armed and trained to kill anything. Calling down air raids or just blowing their opponents away with superior fire power, these guys arenât victims waiting to be slaughtered!\r\n\r\nFang of Vampires - These bloodthirsty hunters donât sparkle in the sunlight. They either burst into flames or hide in the shadows where they drag in their prey to rip them to pieces. Numerous, fast and deceptively strong. You kill them outright or they kill you quickly and messily! Having an assortment of killers at their disposal the Vampires look fancy but are diamond hard fighters.\r\n\r\nPack of Werewolves - Though small in number they make up for this by being extremely hard to kill. Individually, there are no tougher or stronger creatures than Werewolves. A combination of animalistic guile and human sadism.\r\n\r\nHorde of Zombies - Faster and devilishly more clever than their movie counterparts, these walking dead want to munch on your brains and have enough sense to do it successfully. Gone are the slow moving and slack-brained bullet magnets. In come a variety of undead killers whose hunger is matched by their minor sense of self preservation. While not extremely tough, being able to bolster their numbers almost as fast as you can deplete them makes Zombies a force to be reckoned with and fear!\r\n\r\n####[Watch the Promo Video here](http://youtu.be/lErDK8xFJGM)\r\n\r\n**About the Game**\r\n\r\nMonster Town is an action-packed card game where players control gangs of Human soldiers, Vampires, Werewolves and Zombies.
